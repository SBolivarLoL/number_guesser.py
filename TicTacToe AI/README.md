# Design Documentation

### Why classes?
1. My main focus with this project was to get a better understanding of how classes work in Python.
2. Since Python is mostly an OOP language classes was the primary topic to know better.

### How will it work? 
1. The game usually is between two people, but since I was working on the terminal it made more sence to me just to code one human player and a computer player.
2. At firsts the computer player was simple enought to make random moves using random.choice so that the player can interact with the game.
3. After the first version was functional I decides to make the computer player more challenging and added a little minimax AI so the player couldn't win.
